# @operational/visualizations stories

This package contains `@operational/visualizations` stories that showcase rendering libraries capabilities.

They are all grouped into a single package so we can run automated visual tests, thanks to [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/).

You can run stories locally with `yarn storybook` (or `npm run storybook`).
